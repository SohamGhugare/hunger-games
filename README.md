# ⚔️ Hunger Games: Web3 Survival Arena

A multiplayer turn-based survival game inspired by *The Hunger Games*, built for the **Xsolla ZK** blockchain. Players enter the arena via wallet login and compete round-by-round, making strategic decisions like attacking, hiding, searching for supplies, or forming alliances. The game runs a deterministic simulation each round and is powered by smart contracts on the **Xsolla ZK Sepolia testnet**.
